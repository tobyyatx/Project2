### To clarify:
1. The **Project Structure** section is where you describe the organization of your codebase and what each file is for. The text I provided should be inserted there exactly as it is.
2. Just copy the entire block above (with **Features**, **Technologies Used**, etc.), and paste it into your `README.md`.

Once this is done, your `README.md` will be complete, and you can move on to other steps, like pushing your code to GitHub and deploying it to GitHub Pages.
